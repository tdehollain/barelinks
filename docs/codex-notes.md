## State Management

- State for values selected by the user in Select, Multi-Select, Switch, Date Picker, Search input, Tabs should live in the URL as query parameters, managed by Tanstack Router. If you have a doubt, ask me.

## React Specifics

- In general try and avoid useEffect. If you plan to use one, pause and tell me, so I can review if there is a better alternative

## Shadcn components

- always use Shadcn components for generic components like buttons, forms, date-pickers, etc.
